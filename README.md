# Simple Alliances
Teams in vanilla Minecraft are pretty technical, often used for behind the scenes stuff, and are admin-limited, which renders the `/teammsg` command basically useless.
Simple Alliances adds `/alliance` and `/allymsg` as an alternative, allowing you to talk to all your alliance members at once, with no admin permissions required for any part of the process, and even be in multiple alliances at once for maximum interpersonal drama

## How to use
The mod requires no extra steps to setup. Any player can use the following commands to create alliances and interact with the ones they're already in

### Command list

`/alliance create <name> [<displayname>]` creates an alliance and automatically adds the player to it. The display name field is optional and can have spaces

`/alliance invite <name> <username>` adds a player into the alliance and notifies all members

`/alliance leave <name>` removes the player from the alliance. if there are no members left, the alliance is deleted

`/alliance members <alliance>` lists all members of an alliance. Requires either being a part of the alliance or admin permissions

`/allymsg <name> <message>` sends a message to all members of the specified alliance

A votekick command is being worked on and will release in v1.1
## Extra info
I plan to mainly release versions I myself am going to play on, so I will most likely skip a few. If there's a particular version you'd like me to release a version of the mod for, feel free to contact me either on Discord(my username is dianacraft) or by creating an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/DianacraftGaming/simple-alliances/issues), and I'll get that done for you!
# Thank you for enjoying the mod!
